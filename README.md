## Getting started

This project uses yarn by default as you can see from the "yarn.lock files", and we recommend it remain so as to avoid "multiple lock-files"

**Ensure you are using node version latest**
If you have nvm, run `nvm use` command to select node v18 otherwise make sure are using node >=v10:

- Ensure you have your `env variables` for all packages
- Ensure you have `Node >= v10` installed in your system
- Run `yarn in:all`
- Run `yarn dev` and you should see the client running on `https://localhost:8080` and server running on `https://localhost:8080/api/v1`
